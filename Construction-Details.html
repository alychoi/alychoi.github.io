One of my greatest      problems were implementing parallax scrolling and the hovering effect. For      parallax scrolling, I saw examples from w3schools.com and was able to      solve my problem. For the hovering effect, I did trial and error until I      was able to fix my problems. Most of my problems came from the "Places"      section because the hovering effect was not working properly, and although      it isn't perfect, it still worked. Now, I am comfortable using css and      html. I've learned so many new css properties and now I can customize my      own website!</p>  </body></html>
